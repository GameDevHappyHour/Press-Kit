# Using Git LFS
##   Git Large File Storage (LFS) is one of Gitâ€™s solutions to handle large files; 
##   it replaces large files with text pointers while storing the file contents on 
##   a remote server keeping Git operations between host and a server performant.
##   So here I've added a whole list of file extensions for various file types I 
##   want to be controlled by Git LFS. I tell Git that I want to filter, diff 
##   and merge using the LFS tool and finally the -text argument tells Git that 
##   this is not a text file, which is a strange way to tell it that it's a binary file.

# Details per file setting:
#   text    These files should be normalized (i.e. convert CRLF to LF).
#   binary  These files are binary and should be left untouched.
#
# Add diff=lfs merge=lfs to the binary files
# Note that binary is a macro for -text -diff.

# USING LARGE-FILE STORAGE
#
# Note: When making changes to .gitattributes, files must be un-staged 
# and re-staged for changes to be applied:
#
#   git reset HEAD --
#	git add -A
#
# Changes can then be verified using:
#
#	git lfs status | grep LFS:

#   Handle line endings automatically for files detected as
#   text and leave all files detected as binary untouched.
#   This will handle all files NOT defined below.
